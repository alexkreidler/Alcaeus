Alcaeus handles a few such cases by default, described in following\nsections and also allows to extend with custom behaviour.\nLink: rel=\"canonical\"\nIt is not uncommon, especially in the RDF world, that an API can distinguish between an information resource\nand its representation document, ie. actual serialized form. This is described on the \nCool URIs for the Semantic Web document and applies especially\nto abstract concepts and object which cannot be transferred in an eletrconic form (for example a person).\nConsider the example below in which the client requests the document directly which will return the \nrepresentation of the resource and also includes a\ncanonical link relation, thus informing the\nclient that the returned payload represents that particular resource instead.\nGET /api/data/my-resource.json\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nLink: ; rel=\"canonical\"\n\n{\n  \"@id\": \"/api/my-resource\"\n}\n\nHere's a running example showing this in the real.\n \nconst client = require(\"alcaeus@0.4.0\").Hydra;\n\nconst rep = await client.loadResource('http://wikibus-data-test.gear.host/brochures');\n\nrep.root;\n\nPartialCollectionView\nConsider a hydra:Collection which supports paging.

Alcaeus tries to\ngracefully resolve such inconsistency by looking for either both alternatives.\nBelow is such an example, where the request tries an URL without the slash but the actual resource is\nidentified with the slash included.\n \nconst client = require(\"alcaeus@0.4.0\").Hydra;\n\nconst rep = await client.loadResource('http://wikibus-test.gear.host');\n\nrep.root;\n\nRedirected request\nSometimes the request will be redirected not to a document but to a completely different resource.

For\nthat reason there is a types getter which wraps them in an Array-like object which also comes with a contains\nmethod to check if a resource is of give type. \n \nconst client = require(\"alcaeus@0.4.0\").Hydra;\n\nconst rep = await client.loadResource('http://wikibus-test.gear.host/book/1331');\n\nconst example = {\n  types: rep.root.types,\n  isBook: rep.root.types.contains('http://schema.org/Book')\n}\n\nReshaping the JSON structure\nIt is possible to process a resource using JSON-LD compaction algorithm as an ad-hoc way of simplifying\n \nconst client = require(\"alcaeus@0.4.0\").Hydra;\n\nconst rep = await client.loadResource('http://wikibus-test.gear.host/book/1331');\n\nawait rep.root.compact({\n  '@vocab': 'http://wikibus.org/ontology#',\n  '@base': 'http://wikibus.org/',\n  'sch': 'http://schema.org/'\n});\n\n The compact method returns a plain JS object, removing any properties added by Alcaeus.\n\n Compaction will fail miserably if attempted on a graph with cycles. In such case it is necessary to first\n break the cycles by using some JS library like json-cycle or\n circular-json.\n\n There is a more maintainable way of extending the resource objects by applying custom class mixins which\n can add methods and properties to the JS objects without sacrificing other functionalities.

A basic collection is represented by an array of\nits items (members) and the total number of items.\ninterface ICollection {\n    /**\n     * Gets the total number of items within the entire collection.\n     * Note that this number can be larger then the number of `members` in the case of\n     * a partial collections\n     */\n    readonly totalItems: number;\n    /**\n     * Gets the collection member included in the current representation.\n     * In the case of partial collections they may only be a subset of all members\n     */\n    readonly members: IHydraResource[];\n    /**\n     * Gets the views of a partial collection\n     */\n    readonly views?: IView[];\n}\n\nHere's an example of loading a collection which is not paged. In such case the server should respond with a\nrepresentation where the totalItems property equals members.length.   \n\nconst client = require(\"alcaeus@0.4.0\").Hydra;\n\nconst rep = await client.loadResource('http://wikibus-test.gear.host/magazine/Buses/issues');\n\nrep.root;\n\nPaged (partial) collections\nIt is a common scenario to split a large collections into smaller chunks. Typically called pages, Hydra\nuses the term view which means to be more generic way of splitting the collection. Currently the only\none actually specified is a PartialCollectionView. Alcaeus represents it by implementing the \nIPartialCollectionView.\nexport interface IPartialCollectionView {\n    /**\n    * Gets the first page of a collection\n    */\n    readonly first: IHydraResource;\n    /**\n    * Gets the previous page of a collection\n    */\n    readonly previous: IHydraResource;\n    /**\n    * Gets the next page of a collection\n    */\n    readonly next: IHydraResource;\n    /**\n    * Gets the last page of a collection\n    */\n    readonly last: IHydraResource;\n    /**\n     * Gets the actual collection resource, of which this view is part of\n     */\n    readonly collection: HydraResource;\n}\n\nIt is important to notice that requesting a page will actually return the collection object. The view serves\nonly as metadata for how to retrieve more pages or views but the members will still be \"attached\" to the\nactual collection resource.\n\nconst client = require(\"alcaeus@0.4.0\").Hydra;\n\nconst rep = await client.loadResource('http://wikibus-test.gear.host/magazines?page=2');\n\nrep.root;\n\nThis design has the consequence that it is possible to combine individual view (page) resources by simply\nconcatenating members of each one. Combining all pages should produce the complete collection.\n"},"representations/mixins.html":{"url":"representations/mixins.html","title":"Extending resources","keywords":"","body":"Extending resource objects with mixins\n\n\n\nAdding mixins to resource\nExample\nHelper methods\n\n\nBuilt-in mixins\n\n\n\nWorking with absolute URI properties can prove cumbersome. After all who would want to write code like:\nresource['http://schema.org/author']['http://schema.org/name'];\n\nThis is verbose, error prone and probably will be an issue for declarative binding syntax of some libraries\n(I'm looking at you, Polymer).\nResources returned from Alcaeus are composed of JavaScript mixins applied on top of plain JS objects coming from\nthe JSON-LD processing algorithms. Mixins allow creating friendly getters for RDF properties, and methods\nadding some behaviour to your resources.\nAdding mixins to resource\nThere are two steps necessary to apply a mixin:\n\nCreate an object with two members which implements the below interface\n  type Constructor = new (...args: any[]) => T;\n  interface IMixin {\n      Mixin: Constructor;\n      shouldApply(obj: IHydraResource): boolean;\n  }\n\n\nAdd the object to Alcaeus's ResourceFactory\n\n\nThe Mixin property is, obviously, the actual mixin to apply when creating objects from JSON-LD resources.\nThe shouldApply function is used to choose whether a given mixin should be used with a given resource. \n If shouldApply is missing, the mixin will be ignored.\n\nExample\n \nconst client = require(\"alcaeus@0.4.0\").Hydra;\n\nconst Mixin = Base => {\n  return class extends Base {\n    get authorName() {\n      return this['http://schema.org/author']['http://schema.org/name'];\n    }\n  };\n};\n\nconst shouldApply = resource => {\n  return resource.types.contains('http://schema.org/Book');\n};\n\n// Add mixin to the client\nclient.mediaTypeProcessors.RDF.resourceFactory.mixins.push({ Mixin, shouldApply });\n \nconst rep = await client.loadResource('http://wikibus-test.gear.host/book/1331');\n\n// access property defined in mixin\nrep.root.authorName;\n\n A clean way is to export the Mixin and shouldApply function, which is then easily imported to\n add to resource factory.\n\n// AuthorMixin.js\nexport function Mixin(Base) {\n  return class extends Base {};\n}\n\nexport const shouldApply = () => true;\n\n// index.js\nimport Hydra from 'alcaeus';\nimport * as AuthorMixin from './AuthorMixin';\n\nHydra.mediaTypeProcessors.RDF.resourceFactory.mixins.push(AuthorMixin);\n\nHelper methods\nWhen defining a resource mixin it is possible to take advantage of protected methods which make it easier to\naccess the underlying triples.\nexport function Mixin(Base) {\n  return class extends Base {\n    get authorName() {\n      // The `_get` method will simply return coalesce missing property to a `null`\n      // In other words, it will prevent the `undefined` value from being returned\n      return this._get('http://schema.org/author');\n    }\n\n    get chapters() {\n      // `_getArray` will ensure that an `Array` is always returned:\n      // * Wrapping a non-array value\n      // * Empty array if the property is missing\n      return this._getArray('http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/chapter');\n    }\n  };\n}\n\nBuilt-in mixins\nAlcaeus includes a number of mixins which are applied to elements of the Hydra vocabulary.
