The returned object\ncomes with a root property which returns a single resource from within the representation graph.

Alcaeus handles a few such cases by default, described in following\nsections and also allows to extend with custom behaviour.\nLink: rel=\"canonical\"\nIt is not uncommon, especially in the RDF world, that an API can distinguish between an information resource\nand its representation document, ie. actual serialized form. This is described on the\nCool URIs for the Semantic Web document and applies especially\nto abstract concepts and object which cannot be transferred in an eletrconic form (for example a person).\nConsider the example below in which the client requests the document directly which will return the\nrepresentation of the resource and also includes a\ncanonical link relation, thus informing the\nclient that the returned payload represents that particular resource instead.\nGET /api/data/my-resource.json\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nLink: ; rel=\"canonical\"\n\n{\n  \"@id\": \"/api/my-resource\"\n}\n\nHere's a running example showing this in the real.\n\nconst client = require(\"alcaeus@0.5.0\").Hydra;\n\nconst rep = await client.loadResource('https://wikibus-data-test.gear.host/brochures');\n\nrep.root;\n\nPartialCollectionView\nConsider a hydra:Collection which supports paging.
